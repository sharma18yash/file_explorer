# file_explorer
File Explorer should work in two modes -
1. Normal mode (default mode) - used to explore the current directory and navigate the filesystem
        1. Display a list of directories and files in the current folder
        a. Every file in the directory should be displayed on a new line with the following
        attributes for each file -
        i.
        File Name
        ii.
        File Size
        iii.
        Ownership (user and group) and Permissions
        iv.

        b. The file explorer should show entries “.” and “..” for current and parent directory
        respectively
        c. The file explorer should handle scrolling in the case of vertical overflow using keys k &
        l.
        d. User should be able to navigate up and down in the file list using the corresponding
        up and down arrow keys2. Open directories and files When
        enter key is pressed -
        a. Directory - Clear the screen and navigate into the directory and show the directory
        contents as specified in point 1
        b. File - Open the file in vi editor
        3. Traversal
        a. Go back - Left arrow key should take the user to the previously visited directory
        b. Go forward - Right arrow key should take the user to the next directory
        c. Up one level - Backspace key should take the user up one level
        d. Home - h key should take the user to the home folder (the folder where the
        application was started)



2. Command mode - used to enter shell commands
        The root of your application should be the directory where the application was started.
        The application should display data starting from the top-left corner of the terminal window, line-by-
        line. You should be able to handle text rendering if the terminal window is resized. The last line of the
        display screen is to be used as a status bar.
        Normal mode:
        Normal mode is the default mode of your application. It should have the following functionalities -
        1. Display a list of directories and files in the current folder
        a. Every file in the directory should be displayed on a new line with the following
        attributes for each file -
        i.
        File Name
        ii.
        File Size
        iii.
        Ownership (user and group) and Permissions
        iv.

        l.
        d. User should be able to navigate up and down in the file list using the corresponding
        up and down arrow keys
        2. Open directories and files When
        enter key is pressed -
        a. Directory - Clear the screen and navigate into the directory and show the directory
        contents as specified in point 1
        b. File - Open the file in vi editor
        3. Traversal
        a. Go back - Left arrow key should take the user to the previously visited directory
        b. Go forward - Right arrow key should take the user to the next directory
        c. Up one level - Backspace key should take the user up one level
        d. Home - h key should take the user to the home folder (the folder where the
        application was started)
        Command Mode:
        The application should enter the Command button whenever “:” (colon) key is pressed. In the
        command mode, the user should be able to enter different commands. All commands appear in the
        status bar at the bottom.
        1. Copy - ‘copy <source_file(s)> <destination_directory>’
        Move - ‘move <source_file(s)> <destination_directory>’
        Rename - ‘rename <old_filename> <new_filename>’
        a. Eg - copy foo.txt bar.txt baz.mp4 ~/foobar
        move foo.txt bar.txt baz.mp4 ~/foobar
        rename foo.txt bar.txt
        b. Assume that the destination directory exists and you have write permissions.
        c. Copying/Moving directories should also be implemented
        d. The file ownership and permissions should remain intact
        2. Create File - ‘create_file <file_name> <destination_path>’
        Create Directory - ‘create_dir <dir_name> <destination_path>’
        a. Eg - create_file foo.txt ~/foobar
        create_file foo.txt .
        create_dir foo ~/foobar
        3. Delete File - ‘delete_file <file_path>’
        Delete Directory - ‘delete_dir <dir_path>’
        a. On deleting directory, you have to recursively delete all content present inside it.
        4. Goto - ‘goto <location>’
        a. Eg - goto <directory_path>

          5. Search - ‘search <file_name>’ or ‘search <directory_name>’
        a. Search for a given file or folder under the current directory recursively.
        b. Output should be True or False depending on whether the file or folder exists
        6. On pressing ESC key, the application should go back to Normal Mode
        7. On pressing q key, the application should close
